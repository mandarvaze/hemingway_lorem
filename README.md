# HemingwayLorem

Lorem Ipsum style random text generator based on the (public domain) writings of
Ernest Hemingway.

Inspired by [Harry Potter
Ipsum](https://github.com/ananyaneogi/harry-potter-ipsum)
While the idea of hp-ipsum is nice, I wonder if there may be copyright issue. (I
know fair use and all, still..) So I decided to create one from the public
domain text. Hemingway was the first name that come to mind.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `hemingway_lorem` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:hemingway_lorem, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/hemingway_lorem](https://hexdocs.pm/hemingway_lorem).
